# i3-dotfiles

This repo contains my personal i3 window manager configuration.

It's focused on minimalism, keyboard-driven workflow, and clean behavior without unnecessary components. Includes keybindings, autostart apps, and basic setup for audio, network, and screen locking.

Feel free to use or modify anything you find useful.
